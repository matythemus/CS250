How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

You interpret user needs by listening to what they and the stakeholders could possibly tell you that what they would like in the program then whoever the product owner is should actually create the user story and the user story attributes and then it will be reviewed and the development team will figure out how to make the story implemented into the program, the creation of user stories helps out a lot because it puts the ideas in a more laid out plan with attributes that they would require in order to create the idea in the program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I would try to approach developing a program in a simple way. We would try to approach it as a team and also approach the whole process like a startup where we are all trying to make the best product that we can and also do great at communication through the development process. I would also make sure to use all of the things that we learned about agile  in this class and make sure that we have important scrum meetings held so that we could develop the best product in the quickest manner possible.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that what makes a good team member is to be a helper strive for the teams growth and not only your own and then to also be communicative and helpful when it comes to it and know your own weaknesses. If you realize that a good team member does not try to do as much as they can but only what they are knowledgeable enough to do and let the other team members do their share I think it will make a great team and great team environment.
