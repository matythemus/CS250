How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

You interpret user needs by listening to what they and the stakeholders could possibly tell you that what they would like in the program then whoever the product owner is should actually create the user story and the user story attributes and then it will be reviewed and the development team will figure out how to make the story implemented into the program, the creation of user stories helps out a lot because it puts the ideas in a more laid out plan with attributes that they would require in order to create the idea in the program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I would try to approach developing a program in a simple way. We would try to approach it as a team and also approach the whole process like a startup where we are all trying to make the best product that we can and also do great at communication through the development process. I would also make sure to use all of the things that we learned about agile  in this class and make sure that we have important scrum meetings held so that we could develop the best product in the quickest manner possible.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that what makes a good team member is to be a helper strive for the teams growth and not only your own and then to also be communicative and helpful when it comes to it and know your own weaknesses. If you realize that a good team member does not try to do as much as they can but only what they are knowledgeable enough to do and let the other team members do their share I think it will make a great team and great team environment.

Retrospective:

The Scrum master I was in charge of all of the scrum events. He is supposed to be the person that schedules and facilitates all of the scrum events and is supposed to teach to team about using scrum to its fullest potential and helping the team keep on track to be utilizing the scrum methodologies. I helped out team in the travel project by setting up the azure board for us and also facilitating and leading the daily scrum meeting and all that sort of stuff and made sure we were following the scrum protocol.

The Product owner So as the product owner he is a sort of overseer of the communications and things for the project. He deals and reports to the team about the process and how it is going and what the developers are feeling about the project and where they would like it to go.  The product owner helped out the travel project immensely by getting all of the necessary information form the stakeholders and then transcribed the information to the whole team showing us exactly what they are looking for in the finished product. He also dealt with user stories and creating and changing the product backlog.

A tester Is very important to the project. They have to test and run diagnostics on the stuff that they receive from the developer. They need to communicate with the developer and the product owner on how things are going in the testing phases and let the developers know if there is a problem and what they need to fix, so there needs to be direct communication between them and the developers. The Testers helped us out with the project by running a magnitude of tests and showing us all the bugs and errors that the dev team had overlooked in the development process and reported them back to us so that we knew what to fix so that we had correctly working program.

A developer Well they are in charge of the actual development of the project kind of like the backbone. They are the ones that are in charge of creating the actual product and all the code in order to do so. They put the feedback, ideas, and user stories into the program as best as they can and make the product that the users are presented with. They helped with the travel product by creating the program that we could actually show the stakeholders and what brought us closer to the finished product.

I think that the agile approach was well suited to be used in this project, It helped the user stories be able to be changed and adapted as new user stories came up. All we had to do with a new user story is do some of pretty much the same thing but had to change and adapt it a bit in order to get what the new specific user story required so being able to be open and adapt throughout the whole development process made it an easier time to backtrack and change the features that the users and stakeholders wanted to have available to them.

Since we recently switched to a scrum approach instead of waterfall The whole team was still a bit new to this and felt  a bit unhinged when we had talked about making a major change to the project. But even though we were not sure how it was going to turn out we just continued to keep working on the changes and adhering to the agile practices that my team had recently learned and using those ideas really helped us to stay afloat because it actually made it not too hard to make all of the necessary changes and turned out to be an easier thing to do that we had thought that it was going to be because of the room for change that using agile allows.

We all made sure that we were in constant communication throughout the sprints and this project. I think that this answer is supposed to refer to the work in our discussions this past week and even though we had someone not choose product owner, with the responses that we did have I think that it was great that we had that communication it helped to solidify everyone’s ideas and understand what was going on by putting the theoretical project into our hands and actually keeping open communication and learning from one another. In an actual scrum project, I think that there would be much more communication and a tighter bond between the team but I think that even with the discussion it showed that how helpful a meeting or communication could be because everyone can be open to ideas and ask questions and try to get on the right track if they get messed up and work as a true team and not just a group of people working on the same project.


I think that the organizational tool that helped us the most would be to use of the azure board. It was a very helpful tool in order for us to stay connected with the whole team and to stay on track with the deadline that and up to date on what needed to be worked on next. Another thing that really helped out our team was the use of the daily scrums it was great to meet every day and discuss what we were all thinking or struggling with on the project. I would say that two principles that were beneficial to the whole project would be the focusing on individual interactions and responding well to change, those helped us to constantly adapt and also listen to what everyone has to say and how we could make the project better. Another principle that really helped our group was utilizing the idea of a startup mentality because since we had a small team to work with anyway it also gave us motivation and drive and made us focus on creating a great product because we all became so tightknit over the weeks of sprints that we produced a great product with lots of help from the entire team.


For the pros of agile I would say that it made it a more flexible project because agile really promotes the idea of changing. I would say that it also requires less time to complete a project because we all continuously work and do not have to wait for other teams to be done, and that the team is more bonded than other approaches and has a higher level of communication between the team members. I think that some cons to using the agile approach are that in some instances it is not always the best approach it can have less predictability and a less definite time of completion. So, some things like the deadline are not as set in stone as with other approaches. Also, I think that a con could be that since they work right away and do not do as much planning as other approaches that it makes them have to change during what they are working on more often than with a different approach that requires more planning ahead of time.


For this project specifically I think that the agile methods were a great approach because it was a project that worked very well with agile. There were times where we needed to be able to adapt on the spot and we were prepared for those as well as anyone could be and changed things accordingly. Another reason I think it was well suited for this project would be that that it enabled us to have constant communication with each other and the stakeholders, so it helped us to create a great project because we all had constant feedback from many people on how they wanted it to be and how to also make it go in the right direction.
